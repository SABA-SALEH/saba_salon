## Wireframes

These wireframes were created using **Balsamiq** during the Scope Plane phase of the design and planning process for this project. Wireframes are a crucial component in the design phase, providing a clear outline of the website's structure and layout before diving into detailed design and development.

Initially, I used Balsamiq to sketch out my ideas after conducting research. This approach was effective for organizing my thoughts and evaluating which concepts were most viable. However, as the project progressed, I found myself rethinking some of the initial proposals and decided to explore alternative ideas. Despite these changes, the core structure of the wireframes remained intact and was faithfully reflected in the final design.

### Automated Testing
#### Code Validation:

1.	**HTML Validator:**
	- Validate HTML code for all pages to ensure compliance with standards.

    ![HTML Validator](static/images/documentation/screenshots/HTML%20Validator.PNG)
    ![HTML Validator](static/images/documentation/screenshots/HTML%20Validator1.PNG)
    ![HTML Validator](static/images/documentation/screenshots/HTML%20Validator2.PNG)
  
  - Error: Duplicate ID user-options

  - Details: The error indicates that the id attribute user-options has been used more than once in the HTML code. 
  - Cause of the Error: The duplicate ID error occurred because the same id attribute value was assigned to 
    multiple elements within the same page. Specifically, in the templates for different screen sizes (mobile and desktop), both elements used the id user-options:

    - Mobile View: 
    ``` html <a class="text-black nav-link d-block d-lg-none" href="#" id="user-options" ... >```

    - Desktop View: ``` html <a class="text-black nav-link" href="#" id="user-options" ... > ```
    
    This duplication happens because the same id was used for elements that are conditionally rendered based on screen size.


2.	**CSS Validator:**
	- Check stylesheets for compliance with CSS standards and fix any issues.

   ![flake8](static/images/documentation/screenshots/flake81.png)
   ![flake8](static/images/documentation/screenshots/flake82.png)

   - Errors:

   1. **Line Too Long** (`E501`):
     
   2. **Imported but Unused** (`F401`):



#### Lighthouse Audit:
1.  Assess performance, accessibility, and best practices using Lighthouse.
2.  Optimize performance and address any identified issues.

![Lighthouse Audit](static/images/documentation/screenshots/lighthouse.png)

   **Best Practices Score:**
   - You may notice that the **Best Practices** score is lower than expected. This is primarily due to recent changes in browser privacy policies, specifically regarding third-party cookies.

   **Reason for Low Best Practices Score:**
   - As part of the Privacy Sandbox initiative, Chrome and other browsers are increasingly restricting third-party cookies to enhance user privacy. For instance, Stripe, which is used for payment processing on this site, relies on third-party cookies to function properly.

## Bugs and Fixes for Saba Salon
### Issue 1: Handling Available Dates and Times
**Bug:** The application did not provide functionality to retrieve available dates and times for booking a service. Users needed this feature to see open slots and make informed choices when scheduling an appointment.

**Fix:** To resolve this, I implemented a feature to get available and booked times for each service. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

**Backend Implementation:**

- Created a View to Handle Available and Booked Times:
  -  Implemented views to return available and booked times based on the selected date.
- Added get_available_times and get_booked_times Functions:
  - Implemented functions to manage and provide the necessary data for available and booked times.

```python
def get_available_times(request, service_id):
    if request.method == 'GET' and 'booking_date' in request.GET:
        service = get_object_or_404(Service, pk=service_id)
        booking_date = request.GET['booking_date']
        available_times = service.get_available_times(booking_date)
        data = {
            'available_times': available_times
        }
        return JsonResponse(data)
    else:
        return JsonResponse({'error': 'Invalid request'}, status=400)

def get_booked_times(request, service_id):
    if request.method == 'GET' and 'booking_date' in request.GET:
        service = get_object_or_404(Service, pk=service_id)
        booking_date = request.GET['booking_date']
        booked_times_qs = Booking.objects.filter(service=service, date=booking_date).values_list('time', flat=True)
        booked_times = list(booked_times_qs)
        data = {
            'booked_times': booked_times
        }
        return JsonResponse(data)
    else:
        return JsonResponse({'error': 'Invalid request'}, status=400)
```

**Frontend Implementation:**

Implemented JavaScript to fetch available and booked times and update the booking form accordingly.

```javascript
function fetchAvailableAndBookedTimes(serviceId, date, timeSelectElement) {
    var availableTimesUrl = `/services/${serviceId}/get_available_times/?booking_date=${date}`;
    var bookedTimesUrl = `/services/${serviceId}/get_booked_times/?booking_date=${date}`;

    fetch(availableTimesUrl)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            fetch(bookedTimesUrl)
                .then(response => response.json())
                .then(bookedTimesData => {
                    var availableTimes = data.available_times;
                    var bookedTimes = bookedTimesData.booked_times;

                    var filteredTimes = availableTimes.filter(time => !bookedTimes.includes(time));

                    timeSelectElement.innerHTML = '<option value="" disabled selected>Select a time</option>';

                    filteredTimes.forEach(function(timeSlot) {
                        var option = document.createElement('option');
                        option.value = timeSlot;
                        option.textContent = timeSlot;
                        timeSelectElement.appendChild(option);
                    });
                })
                .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching booked times:', error));
        })
        .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching available times:', error));
}
```



### Issue 2: Adding Additional Services to a Booking
**Bug:** The application lacked functionality for users to add additional services to their existing bookings. This was necessary for users who wanted to book multiple services in a single transaction.

**Fix:** Implemented functionality to add additional services to a booking by creating an interface to select and add extra services.

**Frontend Implementation:**
- Added a section to the booking form to manage additional services.
- Used JavaScript to handle the display and selection of additional services.

```html
<div id="additionalServiceContainer" style="display: none;">
    <label for="additional_service_select">Add Another Service:</label>
    <select id="additional_service_select">
        <!-- Options will be populated dynamically -->
    </select>
    <label for="additional_booking_date">Choose Date:</label>
    <input type="date" id="additional_booking_date">
    <label for="additional_booking_time">Choose Time:</label>
    <select id="additional_booking_time">
        <!-- Options will be populated dynamically -->
    </select>
</div>

<button id="toggleAdditionalService">Add Another Service</button>

```

**JavaScript Implementation:**
- Managed the addition of services and their respective booking details.

```javascript
document.getElementById('toggleAdditionalService').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    var additionalServiceContainer = document.getElementById('additionalServiceContainer');
    if (additionalServiceContainer.style.display === 'none') {
        additionalServiceContainer.style.display = 'block';
        event.target.textContent = 'Cancel Adding';
    } else {
        additionalServiceContainer.style.display = 'none';
        event.target.textContent = 'Add Another Service';
    }
});

```

### Issue 3: Updating Cart Items
**Bug:** Users were unable to update the date and time for services in their cart and only view available times. This was necessary to ensure users can modify their bookings and select from available slots only.

**Fix:** Implemented functionality to allow users to update the date and time of services in their cart and display only the available times for the selected date. Below are the solutions for both backend and frontend implementations.

**Backend Implementation:**
- Updating Cart Items:
  - Added a view edit_cart_item to handle updates to date and time for services in the cart.
  - Ensured that the selected date and time are validated and updated in the session cart.

```python

if request.method == 'POST':
        date = request.POST.get('date')
        time = request.POST.get('time')

        if not date or not time:
            messages.error(request, 'Please select both a date and a time.')
            return redirect('cart:view_cart')

        try:
            date = datetime.strptime(date, '%Y-%m-%d').date()
            time = datetime.strptime(time, '%H:%M').time()
        except ValueError:
            messages.error(request, 'Invalid date or time format.')
            return redirect('cart:view_cart')

        item['date'] = date.isoformat()
        item['time'] = time.strftime('%H:%M')

        cart[item_key] = item
        request.session['cart'] = cart
        request.session.modified = True
        print("Updated cart data:", cart)
        messages.success(request, f'{service.name} updated in cart.')
        return redirect('cart:view_cart')

    available_times = service.get_available_times(datetime.now().date())


```

- Fetching Available and Booked Times:
    - Added get_available_times and get_booked_times functions to provide data on available and booked times respectively.

```python
def get_booked_times(request, service_id):
    if request.method == 'GET' and 'booking_date' in request.GET:
        service = get_object_or_404(Service, pk=service_id)
        booking_date = request.GET['booking_date']
        booked_times_qs = Booking.objects.filter(service=service, date=booking_date).values_list('time', flat=True)
        booked_times = list(booked_times_qs)
        data = {
            'booked_times': booked_times
        }
        return JsonResponse(data)
    else:
        return JsonResponse({'error': 'Invalid request'}, status=400)
```

**Frontend Implementation:**

- Handling Date Changes:
   - Implemented JavaScript to handle changes in the booking date, fetch available times, and update the time selection dropdown.

``` javascript
function handleDateChange(event) {
    var dateInput = event.target;
    var form = dateInput.closest('form');

    if (!form) {
        console.error('Form element not found');
        return;
    }

    var serviceIdInput = form.querySelector('input[name="service_id"]');
    if (!serviceIdInput) {
        console.error('Service ID input not found');
        return;
    }

    var serviceId = serviceIdInput.value;
    var timesSelect = form.querySelector('.booking-time');
    if (!timesSelect) {
        console.error('Times select element not found');
        return;
    }

    var bookingDate = dateInput.value;
    fetchAvailableAndBookedTimes(serviceId, bookingDate, timesSelect);
}

```


### Issue 4: Webhook Handler Returning 500 Internal Server Error and No Confirmation Email Sent
**Bug:** The webhook handler for Stripe payment intents was returning a 500 Internal Server Error, and no confirmation email was being sent to users upon successful payment. This was impacting the user experience by not providing payment confirmation and order details.

**Fix:** To resolve this, I updated the webhook handler to correctly retrieve the charge details from Stripe and calculate the grand total. The updated implementation ensures that the payment details are processed correctly, and a confirmation email is sent to users. Below is the fix applied:

**Backend Implementation:**

- Handling Stripe Payment Confirmation:
  - Updated the webhook handler to retrieve the charge details from Stripe using the latest charge information.
  - Calculated the grand total from the retrieved charge amount and updated the order total.

```python
 try:
            stripe_charge = stripe.Charge.retrieve(
                intent.latest_charge
            )
            billing_details = stripe_charge.billing_details
            grand_total = round(stripe_charge.amount / 100, 2)
            order_total = grand_total
```
